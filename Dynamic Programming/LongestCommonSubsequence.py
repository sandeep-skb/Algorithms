#LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. 
#A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
#For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
